Hereâ€™s a 10-line summary of your WAR card game server implementation:

1. The WAR card game server supports multiple games running at the same time.
2. A global waiting_clients list queues players looking for a match.
3. When two players are available, a new game starts in a separate thread.
4. Each game is handled in its own thread to allow concurrent execution.
5. This ensures new connections and games aren't blocked by ongoing ones.
6. Every game maintains its own state, including sockets and cards.
7. This isolation guarantees no interference between games.
8. The server uses simple Python threading instead of async code.
9. Testing with over 1000 clients showed the server remained stable.
10. The multi-threaded approach balances performance and code simplicity.
